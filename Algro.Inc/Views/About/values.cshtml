                    The Values We Share

                </h2>
                <p>In   the services business, success is powered as much by shared values as   by employee skills. Algro's business objectives and shared standards   are designed to benefit not only shareholders and employees, but also   every other participant in the value chain. It is our firm belief that   these objectives can only be achieved through mutual respect and   cooperation.</p>

                <h2>Seven Values</h2>
                <p>Seven shared values have been at the heart of Algro since our   formation. These values influence the way we meet client needs while   respecting the regulatory requirements of each country in which we   operate, and the way we promote ethically sound practices within   Algro and in our partnerships. They are:</p>
                <h3><strong>Honesty</strong></h3>
                <p>Particularly the refusal of unfair business practices aimed at   obtaining a particular contract or advantage. In line with this   principle, Algro has established clear rules with respect to   commissions and gifts of all kinds.</p>
                <h3><strong>Boldness</strong></h3>
                <p>In the sense of an entrepreneurship and desire to take considered   risks balanced by prudence and clear-sightedness, without which a bold   manager can become reckless.</p>
                <h3><strong>Trust</strong></h3>
                <p>It implies a willingness to empower employees and teams, and to allow   managers to experience the effects of their initiatives and decisions.   Trust also implies an open mind and genuine transparency in the flow of   information, and is at the heart of our Innovations never end.</p>
                <h3><strong>Freedom</strong></h3>
                <p>It includes creativity, innovation, independence of mind and respect   for others in their diverse cultures, habits, and customs, all of which   are crucial for a company with a presence in more than 30 countries and   that has over 100 nationalities among its employees.</p>
                <h3><strong>Team spirit</strong></h3>
                <p>With clients, employees, and partners; the ability to share in both good and bad times.</p>
                <h3><strong>Modesty</strong></h3>
                <p>In relations with others and in our approach to issues.</p>
                <h3><strong>Fun</strong></h3>
                <p>Without which any corporate vision is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to implement.</p>
                <p>We’ve created a formal code of ethics to clarify and promote these   practices. Learn more about the way our long-standing values and   practices are reflected in our corporate responsibility and stewardship,   the way we collaborate with our clients, and the way we relate to our   employees.</p>
